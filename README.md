# WhereToEat
Where to Eat takes user input and chooses a randomly generated restaurant for you. You enter a variety of filters including price, type of food, location, etc. and a restaurant matching those filters is selected. The restaurants will be stored in a database and the location of these restaurants will be imposed on a map using the Google API. If for some reason you donâ€™t like the restaurant that is picked for you, you can ask the generator to give you three more random restaurants. With this additional list of random restaurants you can sort them on rating, distance, and busyness.
